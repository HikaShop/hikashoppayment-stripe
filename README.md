# HikaShop Stripe

Stripe payment plugin for HikaShop (open source e-commerce solution for Joomla).

The plugin uses the legacy Stripe API (version 2). 
**The Stripe API used in this plugin is deprecated by Stripe. This plugin won't work anymore and thus is not supported anymore**
Another plugin using the new API, including stripe-js and connect has been devleoped by one of our partner. So if you want to use Stripe with HikaShop, you need to use this plugin instead:
